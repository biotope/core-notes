# Structure proposal
## Participants

## Why?
We were talking about the need of a structured organisation because of the following needs:

- Insecurity (Am I developing in the right direction?)
- Decision making (Should this feature be worked on?)
- Finance (Do we have budget for this task?)
- Overview (What happens in the other repos?)

## Result

Our current proposal for a organisational setup is, that we will have three dedicated roles:

1. The captain
This person will manage the whole budget pool for all of biotope and will make sure, the overall project heads in the right direction.

2. The officers
These persons will be given a small cut of the budget to decide on how to separate this budget over the different projects.

3. The navigators
These persons are experienced in the distinct projects and can ship the progress in the right directions. These are the first go-tos for questions.


Every project (boilerplate, build, generator, etc.) should have one officer and one navigator assigned to it.
One navigator/officer can have multiple projects she cares for.


This structure shall be kept until the projects work on their own.
