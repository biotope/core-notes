# Biotope is a framework which enables you to develop scalabale, platform-agnostic and living frontend component ecosystems

## It helps developers to:
- easily develop ui-components following a unified standard.
- keep focus on developing components, the architecture and dev environment is provided by Biotope.
- build your UI components only once and use them together with vanilla ES6 or the js framework of your choice, in single page applications as well as in traditional server side rendered cms projects.
- make it easy to work with a team of many developers, all providing components to the library.
- easily ensure high quality standards for the whole library even when developed by multiple suppliers.
- build real projects and design system styleguides with a single code source.
- create your own ui library to choose from in your projects.


## It helps companies to:
- Create a UI component library which can be maintained in a central place.
- STILL all ui-components can be used independently in different projects.
- Ensure a consistent UI across all your projects.
- Make it possbile to let multiple partners contribute to the ui library without compatiblity & quality issues.
- Have multiple contractors contribute to the UI library without compatibility & quality issues.
-	Bring their Design System to live. Real usable code, no dummy html components in a seperate styleguide tool.
-	Doesnt matter how big the component library gets. Projects only use components they need. So performance stays high.
- Maintain and extend the ui library over years to avoid getting out-of-date and having to start from scratch again.

## It helps designers to:
