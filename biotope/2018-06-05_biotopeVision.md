# Biotope is a framework and architecture which enables you to develop technology and cms independent frontend component libraries


## It helps developers to:
- produce clean and state of the art frontend code
- develope ui-components on a unified standard and with latest web standards
- keep focus on developing components, the architecture and dev environment is provided by Biotope.
- make it easy to work with a team of many developers on the same component library
- ensure high quality standards for the whole library even when developed by multiple developers
- build real projects and design system styleguides with a single code source
- create your own ui library to chose from in your projects
- use Biotope ui-components in single page applications as well as in traditional server side renderd cms


## It helps companies to:
- Create a UI component library which can be maintained in a central place
- BUT all ui-components can be used independently in different projects
- Create UI consistency over all projects
- Make it possbile to let multiple partners contribute to the ui library without compatiblity & quality issues
-	Bring their Design System to live. Real usable code, no dummy html components in a seperate styleguide tool.
-	Doesnt matter how big the component library gets. Projects only use components they need. So performance stays high.
- Maintain and extend the ui library over years without the need for a relaunch
