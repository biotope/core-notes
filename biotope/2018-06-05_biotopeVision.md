# Biotope is a framework which enables you to develop scalabale, platform-agnostic frontend component ecosystems

## It helps developers to:
- easily develop ui-components following a unified standard
- keep focus on developing components, the architecture and dev environment is provided by Biotope.
- build platform-agnostic ui components which can be used in single page applications as well as in traditional server side rendered cms projects
- make it easy to work with a team of many developers, all providing components to the library
- easily ensure high quality standards for the whole library even when developed by multiple suppliers
- build real projects and design system styleguides with a single code source
- create your own ui library to choose from in your projects


## It helps companies to:
- Create a UI component library which can be maintained in a central place
- BUT all ui-components can be used independently in different projects
- Create UI consistency over all projects
- Make it possbile to let multiple partners contribute to the ui library without compatiblity & quality issues
-	Bring their Design System to live. Real usable code, no dummy html components in a seperate styleguide tool.
-	Doesnt matter how big the component library gets. Projects only use components they need. So performance stays high.
- Maintain and extend the ui library over years without the need for a relaunch
