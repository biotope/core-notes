1. biotope-build
2. biotope-boilerplate
3. biotope.sh (Dev Page)

## biotope-build
@tiagomapmarquez is currently working on vNext of biotope build.
The current codebase is available at https://github.com/biotope/biotope-build/tree/v7  
The corresponding branch in biotope-boilerplate can be found here: https://github.com/biotope/biotope-boilerplate/tree/v7
@sheepfromheaven will try these changes and give feedback.

## biotope-boilerplate
@sheepfromheaven proposed to get rid of the resources folder, as for the new system we should only need the components folder.
If there are any risks we see, we will collect them here: https://github.com/biotope/biotope-boilerplate/issues/83  
Feedback appreciated.

## biotope.sh
@jurekbarth and @sheepfromheaven have prepared a first draft for the text of the home page. @tiagomapmarquez and @timomayer will give feedback until end of the next week.
After the feedback we want to hand the texts over to a designer, to get a concept for the website.  
As an good example, we will create the website with biotope!  
⚠️ For the biotope loge, we have to take care that it is reusable in many cases (stickers, shirts, presentations, ...)  
This page will also hold the "overall" biotope documentation. How everything works together and how to get started.
