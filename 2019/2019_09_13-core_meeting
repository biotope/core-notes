# Agenda

1. Update Build
2. Update Element
3. Open task
4. Omit breaking PRs

## Update Build
- We will have a build system with steps defined as array of plugins
- Each buildstep is a plugin
- We have the feeling the goal of october is at risk
- Still a lot of open steps for "older" projects

## Update Element
- We need to add migration guide for new version
- Versioned docs will be added there

## Open tasks
We noticed the tasks we define in these meetings, do not get resolved.
We now alwas create an issue for each tasks, which will make it easier to navigate on that.

## Breaking PRs
We do not want to validate based on commits, but rather on a PR level.
To enforce that, we will integrate PR templates which contain:
- Breaking
- Features
- Fixes
- Documented
- Tested
